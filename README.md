_Question: How many sentences does the Book of Proverbs include?_

## What's the big idea?

The idea is to create lists that capture and rank the learners' progress so as to stir up motivation to learn Proverbs by heart.
To appear in the next list the lerners have to recite (if relevant: to each other) their whole repertory F2F.

_Continuity: Intervals may be months, weeks, or shorter._

You can also talk about the contents afterwards.
If there arises a dispute, break it up and ask them to find a suitable verse in Proverbs.
Point out the danger of misusing the Bible against each other.

1. Rank by absolute repertory. Min = 1, Max = 912 verses.
2. Rank by least forgotten.

Prices to win. Ask parents, others, or themselves what.
Or is rank on list enough?

Edit: Thomas: A group that encourages one another.

["... A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."](https://www.bibleserver.com/ESV/John13%3A34-35)

Edit: ["My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments, for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you. Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you; bind them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart..."](https://www.bibleserver.com/ESV/Proverbs3%3A1-3)

Example: Duet, where one accelerates, finishes earlier and shouts: "First!".

_First half of the table encourage 2nd half._

Edit: B.: It should all be done in prayer anyway, that it goes in really well and bears fruit.
