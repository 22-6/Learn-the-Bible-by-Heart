# Learn-the-Bible-by-Heart

As an example, we start with [Proverbs](https://www.bibleserver.com/ESV/Proverbs1).

["My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments, for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you. Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you; bind them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart..."](https://www.bibleserver.com/ESV/Proverbs3%3A1-3)

It should all be done in prayer anyway, that it goes in really well and bears fruit.

Not like a band playing, where one speeds up, finishes earlier and shouts: "First!". _First half of the table tutor the 2nd half._

Ask parents, others, or themselves what prizes are to be won or is rank on a list enough?
