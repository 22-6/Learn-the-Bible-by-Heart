# Learn-the-Bible-by-Heart
Creating tools that encourage learning the Bible by heart.

## What's the big idea?

The idea is to create a group and encourage the participants to learn the Bible by heart.

In this case, we are starting with learning [Proverbs](https://www.bibleserver.com/ESV/Proverbs1).

## Basic Stats

- The Book of Proverbs has 31 chapters.
- Chapters 1-2 have 55 verses.
- Chapters 3-5 have 85 verses.
- Chapters 6-10 have 148 verses.
- Chapters 11-18 have 235 verses.
- Chapters 19-31 have 389 verses.
- Therefore, the Book of Proverbs has 912 verses.

_Question: How many sentences does the Book of Proverbs include?_

## Tools to stir up motivation to learn

Meet in certain intervals.

The learners recite their current repertory F2F to each other.

["My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments, for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you. Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you; bind them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart..."](https://www.bibleserver.com/ESV/Proverbs3%3A1-3)

1. Note the participants' absolute current repertory. Min = 1, Max = 912 verses.
2. Rank by least forgotten.

_Continuity: Intervals may be months, weeks, or shorter._

You can also talk about the contents afterwards, thus encouraging each other.

_First half of the table tutor the 2nd half._

Anti-example: Duet, where one accelerates, finishes earlier and shouts: "First!".

Prices to win. Ask parents, others, or themselves what.
Or is rank on list enough?

If there arises a dispute, break it up and ask them to find a suitable verse in Proverbs.

It should all be done in prayer anyway, that it goes in really well and bears fruit.
Point out the danger of misusing the Bible against each other.


["... A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."](https://www.bibleserver.com/ESV/John13%3A34-35)
